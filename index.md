## Course Description

Python is an object-oriented programming language that is ideal for biological data analysis. The course will start from zero knowledge, and will introduce the participants to all the basic concepts of Python such as calculating, organizing data, reading and writing files, program logic and writing larger programs. All the examples and practical sessions will focus on solving biological problems. In particular the sessions will cover:

+ working with DNA and protein sequences
+ data retrieval from files and their manipulation
+ running applications, such as BLAST, locally and from a script
+ finding motifs in sequence
+ parsing common file formats (Uniprot, GenBank, PDB, BLAST) with Biopython
+ ways to find and correct program errors

The course will be highly interactive and the students will continuously put theory into practice while learning. 

## Target Audience
End-users of bioinformatics databases and tools that need to manage large files and/or a large number of files and aim at developing hands-on capabilities for their analysis by writing their own or adapting somebody else's scripts in an autonomous way.
