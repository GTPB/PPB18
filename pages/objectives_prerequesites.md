At the end of the course, the participants will have a good understanding of Python basics and will have acquired the skills to manage any type of bioinformatics database record and to run applications from scripts. Basic Unix/Linux skills will be provided at the beginning of the course.

### Course Pre-requisites
Basic familiarity with bioinformatics data resources such as Uniprot/Swiss-Prot, Blast, ENSEMBL, PDB, etc. The course is directed to biologists with little or no programming experience and aims at making them capable to use Python to autonomously manage and analyse biological data.


Participants are asked to take a look at [pre-course reading material on the Unix/Linux command line](https://rawgit.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Critical-Guides/gh-pages/HTML/Flip_Day0.html) *before* the course, so that we can avoid wasting valuable training time and enter the core subject almost directly, after a brief discussion.
